## Issues

**The wrong character set being used**<br />
I see this issue a lot, you muse set the character set to muli-byte. If you do not you will see an error like [this](https://i.gyazo.com/9407cb6bbb2f2bae25ea5615cc4166bb.png). <br />
Go into the project properties and follow change the character set to multi-byte. <br />

**Cannot open source file "pch.h" or "stafdx.h"** <br />
This issue comes from not creating an empty project file. This is very easy to fix, and the error will look like [this](https://gyazo.com/fb4f6fa466ed438e31236af444dc5d96).<br />
First delete the line that says ```#include "pch.h"``` or ```#include "stafdx.h"``` <br />
Go into the project properties and [turn off using pre-compiled headers](https://i.gyazo.com/cd5056afcd785e168b737aa36efa1f97.png). <br />
